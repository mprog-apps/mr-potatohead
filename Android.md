# Mr. Potatohead


## Objectives

- Create a first app!
- Practice with Git.
- Use layouts to design your user interface.


## Background

![Screenshot of Mr. Potato Head](potato.png)

Imagine an app that displays a "Mr. Potato Head" toy on the screen. The toy has several accessories and body parts that can be placed on it, such as eyes, nose, mouth, ears, hat, shoes, and so on.

Initially your app should display only the toy's body, but if the user checks/unchecks any of the checkboxes below the toy, the corresponding body part or accessory should appear/disappear.

The way to display the various body parts is to create a separate view for each part, and lay them out so that they are superimposed on top of each other.

## Getting started

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/211268587" width="320" height="200" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

1.  Create a new Android studio project, using these settings:
    - Choose API 24 (Nougat) unless your own phone has an older operating system
    - Start with an Empty Activity which is called `MainActivity`
    - Leave all other settings unchanged

2.  Go to <https://github.com/new> and create a new, empty repository. Do not allow it to add a `README`. You may leave all other settings unchanged.

3.  Add a git repository to the project on your computer. Go to Android Studio, and in the menu choose **VCS -> Enable Version Control Integration**. Choose **git** as the type and confirm. This will not change much, but sets us up for the next steps.

    Note: if you get a popup to ask whether you would like to add some file to the repository, answer "No" for now. If you answer "Yes", things may get complicated later on.

4.  Link the local repository to your Github project. Choose **VCS -> Git -> Remotes...**. Add a remote with name "origin". You can find the URL on the Github project you just created:

    ![find the git url on the github website for the project you just created](git-url.png)

5.  Android Studio has generated quite a few files for your project already. To add these, let's **commit** and **push** those files to Github. Press **Cmd-K** or **Ctrl-K** to show the Commit Changes screen. There, you should see a long list of "unversioned files", which should be selected. Enter a commit message `Initial project`, turn off code analysis, and then press the **commit** button.

    **Note:** some files may be selected while there are still a lot of "unversioned files". Make
    sure to select *all* of the files before continuing.

6.  Press **Cmd-Shift-K** or **Ctrl-Shift-K** to show the Push Commits dialog. Press the **Push** button to send everything to Github.

Your project files should now be visible on Github like in the picture below. All of the files and folders should be there! If not, ask for help!

## Add images to the project

For this project, we'll only work with the two most important files in your Android project: `MainActivity.java`, which contains the back-end code for your main screen; and `activity_main.xml`, which contains the definition of what the main screen looks like. You'll find them in the **project browser**:

![](file-browser.png)

No need to create original art! Here's [image files](mr-potato-head-images.zip) for each body part and accessory, such as `body.png`, `ears.png`, `hat.png`. Let's add those to the project.

1. Just for a second, switch to the Project View using this dropdown you can find on the left hand side of your IDE:

    ![](project-view.png)

2. Navigate to app -> src -> main -> res -> drawable. Now, drag the downloaded image files into that `drawable` folder. Android Studio will offer to move/copy them, and then to add them to your local git repository. That's all fine.

3. Jump back to the Android View using the same dropdown as in step 1. You can now use the images from your app.

## Creating the user interface

Let's design the interface:

![](layout.png)

1.  Double-click `activity_main.xml` in the project browser to open it. 

2.  Your layout currently contains a `Label` with the text `Hello World!`. Click it and press delete (backspace) to remove it from the layout.

3.  Now go to the Palette (remember where? it was in the video!). Select the "Layouts" category and drag a `FrameLayout` to the editor. This layout is perfect for stacking our potato images on top of each other.

4.  Also add a `GridLayout` to the screen. That one nicely fits the idea of presenting a grid of checkboxes.

    > Note that the activity already contained a `ConstraintLayout`. Now you've added to different types of layout *into* that top-level layout.

5.  Roughly position both layouts like they are in the picture above. Later, we'll add constraints for automatically positioning them on different screen sizes.

6.  Drag an `ImageView` from the palette to the `FrameLayout`. Immediately, a dialog pops up, allowing you to choose one of the `.png` files that you just added to the project. Start with the body!

7.  Make sure all the images are the same size and positioned right on top of each other. Currently, you can see all of them, but we'll make sure they are invisible when the app starts. Find the Attributes sidebar like in the screen shot below:

    ![](attributes.png)

    For each of the images, set the `visibility` attribute to `invisible`. It is probably listed under "favorite attributes", but if you can't find it, choose the blue link "View all attributes" all the way down the Attributes sidebar.
    
    > Tip: because all images are supposed to be on top of each other, it's hard to select individual items. In that case, you can use the component tree to select the image views. You can even select multiple views and set the attributes for all of them:
    
    ![](component.png)

8.  Now it's time to add checkboxes. Drag them from the Palette and set their `text` to reflect the body parts that are present in the images.

9.  Finally, we'll need to add constraints. In the component tree, select the `gridLayout` and the `frameLayout`. Right-click and select Chain > Create Vertical Chain. This chain is the basis for an automatic layout.

10. Using your experience from the Android Lab about constraint layouts, make the screen even better, and try different phone sizes to check that the layout fits nicely for each of them!


## Connecting everything with code

First, some final setup. Checkboxes can *do* something when tapped on the phone. In Android, even without programming something, they can be checked on and off visually, but that is not particularly useful if there is no further behaviour attached. 

Select one of those checkboxes, and in the attributes sidebar find the `onClick` attribute. This attribute allows you to attach a method to a view (in this case a checkbox) which you can then use to program specific behaviour that should be executed when someone clicks on it. Select the `onClick` attribute, and enter `checkClicked` as its value: this is the name of the method that will be called whenever someone selects or unselects the checkbox. Do this for each of the checkboxes. 

All of these checkboxes are now connected to the same `checkClicked` method, which we will use to make our program actually do something when someone checks one of them! 

> In Android, there is a separation between the layout files and the program logic. The layout files, which are of the `xml` format are not where you write your actual program. They are a mostly static representation of what the app should look like. In the activities, which are `.java` files, you will actually write code that affects the app's run time behaviour.  

1.  Now, switch to the code, by double-clicking `MainActivity` in the Java folder in the project browser.

2.  Add a method `checkClicked()` to the activity class and add a `Log` message like this:

    ![](checkClicked.png)

3.  Now try your app! Run it on your phone or in the simulator. Your app should log something whenever you click one of the checkboxes. If not, ask for help!

Now, every single checkbox is connected to the same method. How do we figure out which one it is? We only have a single clue: the parameter `View v`. This parameter is a **reference** to our checkbox view on the screen (the one that was clicked). However, this parameter is of type `View`, not of type `CheckBox`. It is common (and sometimes needed) to convert this parameter before doing anything else with it.

1.  To access all methods from the `CheckBox` class, we have to cast the parameter. Create a temporary variable to hold the `CheckBox`:

        CheckBox checkbox = (CheckBox) v;

    As you might remember, putting a type between rounded brackets will **cast** something to that type (if possible!).
    
    > The important part: we are absolutely sure that we connected the `checkClicked()` method only to checkboxes, so this is a safe thing to do! We may *assume* that the thing in `v` is a `CheckBox`.

2.  Now that we have a variable of type CheckBox, we can call the method `getText()` on it. Remember from the layout that you set the `text` property of each checkbox? This is the same.

3.  To get the text of a checkbox as a simple `String`, call `checkbox.getText().toString()`. That's it! Oh, and to find out if the checkbox is checked or not, use the `isChecked()` method.

Finally, we need to be able to switch some of the images on and off, depending on the state of the checkboxes. 

1.  To set the visibility, you will need a reference to the image view that you would like to manipulate. Here's a sample:

        ImageView image = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.arms);

    The idea (no pun intended) of `findViewById()` is that you specify the **R**esource id of your image view. When running on the phone, the Android system will then find it for you on the screen and provide you with a reference.
    
    What ID should you provide? This depends on the name that you have set for the view. Currently, your imageviews may have uninformative names such as `imageView2`. Best to head to the layout designer, click each of the image views, and set an appropriate name in the attributes sidebar. Tip: use the component tree to select each of the views.

2.  As soon as you have a reference to one of the images, you can set whether or not it (or any other control) is visible on the screen by calling its `setVisibility()` method. The `setVisibility` method accepts a parameter such as `View.VISIBLE` or `View.INVISIBLE`. There is also a `getVisibility()` method if you need to check whether a widget is currently visible.

## Finishing the checkbox management

There's only a little bit of Java code to write, in order to have each checkbox show and hide the corresponding image. Because we use lots of separate images, expect your code to be slightly inefficient in terms of lines of code! It's up to you how to handle each of the cases. Start simple though! It is fine to have a working solution that is slightly inefficient first and improve from there. 


## Memory management

There's a bug in your app! Because of how Android works, your layout may be reloaded whenever you leave your app, switch to another app, and then return. This way, memory usage can be kept low. Your layout may also be reloaded as the phone is rotated. However, even though your checkboxes will be automatically reloaded in the same state as you left them (checked/unchecked), your image views will not!

You can preserve this state by using the `onSaveInstanceState()` method. It is a method that you can optionally override in your activity. 

    public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
        super.onSaveInstanceState(outState); // always call super
        outState.putInt("name", value);
        outState.putString("name", value);
        ...
    }

You can use the `Bundle` to save items. This same bundle will be delivered to you when the layout is reloaded. Actually, that bundle was already in your activity! It is a parameter to the `onCreate()` method. So in `onCreate()`, you can use some methods to **restore** the state of your views:

    ... = savedInstanceState.getInt("name");
    ... = savedInstanceState.getString("name");

Now, your task is to save the `visibility` state of all `ImageViews`. Which get/put method seems appropriate to do this? Google "android bundle" to get a list of all get/put methods.


## Some ideas for extras

You may have some time left to make your app a bit better. Here are a few ideas that you can work on:

- Phones can also be rotated to landscape mode. Currently, our layout doesn't work too well for this mode. Mr. Potatohad should probably be to the left and the checkboxes to the right. You can use two layouts for portrait and landscape, respectively, to fix this. In the layout editor, choose "Add landscape layout" to get started.

- Think about how you can make the code for `checkboxClicked()` as tiny as possible, even when handling such a large a mount of checkboxes.
