# iOS: Mr. Potatohead

## Objectives

- Create a first app!
- Practice with Git.
- Use layouts to design your user interface.


## Background

![Screenshot of Mr. Potato Head](potato.png)

Imagine an app that displays a "Mr. Potato Head" toy on the screen. The toy has several accessories and body parts that can be placed on it, such as eyes, nose, mouth, ears, hat, shoes, and so on.

Initially your app should display only the toy's body, but if the user checks/unchecks any of the checkboxes below the toy, the corresponding body part or accessory should appear/disappear.

The way to display the various body parts is to create a separate view for each part, and lay them out so that they are superimposed on top of each other.

## Getting started 

Because of the short time limit, you'll start out with a partly set up Xcode project. Go to [insert git repo link] and fork this repository. Next, clone this repository onto your computer. 

Go the the newly cloned repository on your computer and have a look around. You'll notice that there is a `Mr. Potatohead` folder, a file called `Mr. Potatohead.xcodeproj`, and a README.md. The `Mr. Potatohead.xcodeproj` file is the file that contains your project. Go ahead and open this file. If everything goes to plan this should open the Mr. Potatohead project in Xcode.  

UITLEG OVER HOE XCODE ER UIT ZIET. 
The `AppDelegate.swift` file contains the []. The `PotatoViewController.swift` is the file that will hold the code that makes the app behave like you want it to. This is the file where you'll be writing code. 

The `PotatoViewController.swift` file is a file corresponding to a `ViewController`: a file that controls what a user will see (view) on their phone screen. You can create the layout of the app in the storyboard.
