#iOS: Mr. Potatohead

## Objectives

- Create a first app!
- Practice with Git.
- Use layouts to design your user interface.


## Background

![Screenshot of Mr. Potato Head](potato.png)

Imagine an app that displays a "Mr. Potato Head" toy on the screen. The toy has several accessories and body parts that can be placed on it, such as eyes, nose, mouth, ears, hat, shoes, and so on.

Initially your app should display only the toy's body, but if the user checks/unchecks any of the checkboxes below the toy, the corresponding body part or accessory should appear/disappear.

The way to display the various body parts is to create a separate view for each part, and lay them out so that they are superimposed on top of each other.
